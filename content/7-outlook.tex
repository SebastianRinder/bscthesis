- more than one dimensional actions
- non-linear action selection policies
- higher dimensional environment with traj kernel
- measure trajectory differences also with state values, not only action values
- Implementing the OpenAI Gym grants us the classic control problems like cart pole, mountain car, and acrobot. Furthermore a lot of more complex environments like a humanoid walker or some Atari games are provided\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BrockmanCPSSTZ16}. This will facilitate future research working with higher dimensional problems.
