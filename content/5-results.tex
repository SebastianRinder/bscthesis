We plot the mean and the standard deviation of the cumulative reward for all kernel runs. One kernel run consists of a number of trials depending on the experiment. We use more than one trial per kernel to compenstate for the variable result one run can produce. Also, due to high variations between iteration steps, all plots are smoothed by a moving mean of 15 steps. And the standard deviation values are divided by five to maintain readability when three or four different kernel plots are present in one graph. Each plot includes the mean of every kernel's outcome as a line and the corresponding standard deviation as a shaded area above and below. The green and blue graph show the two standard kernels, squared exponential and Matérn 5/2, and the magenta and red graph show the trajectory kernels. The trajectory kernel proposed by \cite{wilson2014using} is marked as the magenta one, whereas the trajectory kernel we come up with (Section \ref{sec:ownTK}) is marked as the red one. Also a table is provided for each experiment showing the benchmark data for corresponding kernels. The column \textbf{mean(time)} contains the mean value of the minutes needed for each trail and the column \textbf{std(time)} the associated standard deviation. The column \textbf{time performance} relates the time needed for the whole run to the time needed for the squared exponential kernel run. If the percentage is negative the associated kernel took more time than the squared exponential kernel. The last column, \textbf{learning performance}, compares the summarized cumulative rewards to those of the squared exponential kernel. If the percentage is positive then the overall learning performance is better than the squared exponential kernel ones.

\section{Learning performance}

Here we plot the learning performance of each experiment. We also provide tables with corresponding benchmark data.

\subsection{Cart pole}
This subsection contains the results of the different Cart Pole setups.

\subsubsection{Matlab implementation of Cart pole on the global optimizer}

In Figure \ref{fig:cartpoleMatlabGlobal} we plot four differnet kernel runs of the MATLAB CartPole implementation in the global Bayesian optimization context. Our MATLAB CartPole implementation runs at most until 1000 time steps. For this implementation we use a continuous action selection policy with four dimensions. Ten trials were completed on each kernel to observe the average performance.
